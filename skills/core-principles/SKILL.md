# Core Principles

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Every file (CSS, Go, JS) must have a single, well-defined purpose. This must be reflected in both the file's content and its naming convention.

- **Mandatory Dependency Injection (DI):**
    - **No Global State:** Avoid direct system calls (OS, Network) in logic.
    - **Interfaces:** Define interfaces for external dependencies (`Downloader`, `ProcessManager`).
    - **Composition:** Main structs must hold these interfaces.
    - **Injection:** `cmd/<app_name>/main.go` is the ONLY place where "Real" implementations are injected.
    - **Thin Main / Fat Library:** `cmd/*/main.go` files MUST be minimal — only argument parsing and dependency injection. ALL business logic MUST live in exported, testable library functions. Never put orchestration logic, conditionals, or error handling beyond basic print/exit in main.

- **AI-Consumable CLIs (Execution Contract):** Any `cmd/*` binary that may be driven by an automation or LLM (not only humans) MUST honor a deterministic execution contract so a caller can branch on results without a human:
    - **Non-interactive by default:** running with no arguments prints help and exits — it never blocks on a TUI or `stdin`. Interactive/TUI modes are opt-in behind an explicit flag (e.g. `-tui`). Long-lived daemons (`-mcp`) are non-interactive too: agents talk to them over their protocol, not stdin.
    - **Stream separation — stdout = data, stderr = diagnostics:** `stdout` carries only consumable output (help, a resolved value, a machine result); `stderr` carries all logs, progress and diagnostics. A caller capturing stdout must get clean output — use `fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, …)` for anything diagnostic.
    - **Exit codes as contract:** `0` on success (including help printed and clean shutdown); non-zero on bad/conflicting flags or startup failure. The agent branches on the code, not on prose. Library functions return errors; the thin `main` maps them to exit codes (that mapping is the only logic allowed in `main`).
    - **Structured results belong to the tool surface:** when an agent needs rich results, expose them through the program's protocol layer (e.g. MCP/JSON-RPC tools), not by parsing free-form stdout.

- **Views belong to the consumer (libraries render no pages):** A reusable library exposes flows, data and contracts — routes (`POST /login`), models (`model.Definition`), callbacks, tokens. HOW anything looks (HTML pages, branding, layout composition) is created by the **consuming app** in its composition root (e.g. `config/`), typically with `tinywasm/form` over the library's generated models plus the app's own CSS. A library that renders its own HTML page is a design smell: split the flow (stays in the library) from the view (moves to the consumer). Published layout skeletons (`tinywasm/layout`) are the one exception — layout structure IS their single responsibility, and even they define only WHERE things go, never WHAT they contain.

- **Framework-less Development:** For Web projects, use only the **Standard Library** (HTML/CSS/JS). No external frameworks or libraries are allowed.
- **CSS-First Interactivity:** Minimize JavaScript usage. All UI interactivity (toggles, menus, states) must be implemented using pure CSS whenever possible.
- **Minimalist JS:** Use JavaScript only as a last resort for logic that cannot be handled by CSS or the Go backend.

- **Strict File Structure:**
    - **Flat Hierarchy:** Go libraries must avoid subdirectories. Keep files in the root.
    - **Max 500 lines:** Files exceeding 500 lines MUST be subdivided and renamed by domain.
    - **Test Organization:** If >5 test files exist in the root, move **ALL** tests to a `tests/` directory.
