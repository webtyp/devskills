# Development Protocols

- **Language Protocol:** Plans and documentation must be generated in **English**. Chat conversations with the user must match the language used by the user (mirroring).
- **Strategic Justification:** Always provide the rationale for your chosen solution based on best practices, offering alternatives and explaining why the selection fits the context.
- **Explicit Execution:** Never start writing/modifying actual codebase source code unless explicitly told to "execute the plan", "ok", or "ejecuta".

- **Harness Plan Mode (any agent with a built-in plan mode — e.g. Claude Code, Gemini CLI):**
    - **Plan Mirroring:** When the harness's plan mode creates a plan file at a system path (e.g. `~/.claude/plans/`), you MUST ALSO create or update `docs/PLAN.md` inside the active project's repository with the same final plan content. The system plan file is harness infrastructure; `docs/PLAN.md` is the canonical source of truth for execution agents.
    - **Plan Location Priority:** Always prefer writing plans inside the project repository. If the plan mode forces a system path, treat it as a draft and mirror the final content to the project before requesting plan approval.
